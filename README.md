## After Cloning This Repository
After cloning this repository locally, be sure to be inside of this project and then execute the **`./configure-repo.sh`** script. This will ensure that Git doesn't allow you to commit output to any `*.ipynb` files.

This requires that when you make a commit, you have access to the `jupyter` command. If you get error messages upon adding `*.ipynb` files, ensure that you have the `jupyter` command accessible at the time that you are adding/committing changes to this project.
